# Electronic Diary Program

## Description

This program is designed to manage contacts in an electronic address book. It allows users to enter and store contact information for up to 10 people.

The program is the final project of the Java beginners course by TodoCOde https://todocodeacademy.com/course/java-para-principiantes/

## Features

### A. Data Entry
The program allows users to enter the following data for each contact:
- ID
- First Name
- Last Name
- Date of Birth
- Telephone Number
- Address

Each of these data fields is represented using text fields in the program's user interface.

### B. Data Storage
To store contact information, the program uses a vector to hold the values for each field. This vector is designed to accommodate up to 10 contacts. Each index in the vector corresponds to a specific person's data, making it easy to retrieve and manipulate individual contact information.

### C. Loading and Retrieval of Data
Users can load contact data into the vector by clicking the "Load" button. Once the data is loaded, the program allows users to navigate through the vector to find and view the loaded contact information.
